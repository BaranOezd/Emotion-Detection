Dear Honest Guide, 

Ty for your amazing videos. After watching your latest, I want to rant about something that bothered me when I visited Prague: AirBnb.

I knew Prague was a bit tourist oriented but once I checked a place to stay I finally understood how crazy it was. It looks like huge real estate companies bought entire streets in Prague and rented them on Airbnb. There were some 'hosts' that had more than 100 places available on airbnb. I had to stay with one of them, and they made me come to their office to check in!' When I got there there were already others waiting to grab their keys. They hired workers to manage the keys and the cleaning.

I know Airbnb has become controversial on its own but this was an entire new level! I can't believe how devastating that must be for the locals. I can't understand why city won't regulate this nonsense!

Thanks for the videos
Best, 
Baran

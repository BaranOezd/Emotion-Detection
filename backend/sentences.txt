I feel like the world has lost all its color and joy. Every day feels heavier than the last, and I don't know how to go on. I miss the person I used to be before everything fell apart. No matter how hard I try, the emptiness never seems to go away. I've lost the only thing that gave my life meaning and direction. It's like every step forward only reminds me of everything I've lost.
